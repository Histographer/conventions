#### Branching og merging

* Protected master branch
* Use jira branching
* Regularly merge master branch into your branch
* When the task is implemented, we do a code review and back-of-the-envelop testing before merging.

#### Commit style

We use a defined commit style, so it is easy to follow what is done on each commit. Try to use small commits. 

* docs: Documentation only changes
* feat: A new feature
* fix: A bug fix
* refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
* build: Changes in dependencies

Example
`feat: add frontend login form`
